# Support PVDC

If you like this plugin, you can support me by **[sponsoring me on GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Wyzebb)**. You can also **[donate on Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/wyzebb)**.

You can also support the plugin through feedback and engaging with the community. **[Join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/akbd8EPSgr)**!

I really appreciate any support you can give as it supports the growth of my plugins and allows me to do more cool things!

### Goals

- I am looking to partner with PebbleHost eventually as they offer great prices for an even better service! I use their servers for hosting my servers and test server and it would be cool to partner with them in the future!

- To become eligible, PVDC needs to reach 50k downloads, so I truly appreciate every download. Let's keep growing!

Currently, I have an [affiliate link with PebbleHost](https://billing.pebblehost.com/aff.php?aff=4366), which is what I will use to pledge my support to them for now. I genuinely recommend them and if you buy a server, consider buying from this link. Thanks :smile:
