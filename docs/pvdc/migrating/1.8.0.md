### How to Migrate
- Read the **[the priority page](../getting-started/priority.md)** as the priority system has been overhauled
- Customise messages in the `/lang` folder as messages have been moved here from `config.yml`
- Use bedrock options in `config.yml` and for other name prefixes, use LuckPerms as the prefix system has been removed
