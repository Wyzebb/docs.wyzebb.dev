### How to Migrate
- Update permission nodes (see **[the permissions page](../usage/permissions.md)**)
- Don't use the `setchunks` command as it has been removed
- Read the **[the priority page](../getting-started/priority.md)** as the priority system has been overhauled
- Customise messages in the `/lang` folder as messages have been moved here from `config.yml`
