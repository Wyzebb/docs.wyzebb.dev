# AFK System

## **AFK System**
- If a player goes AFK, after a certain amount of time, their view distance will be restricted to stop AFK players making the server lag.
- Restriction distance and the time it takes to consider a player AFK are customisable.
- There is a bypass permission to stop your view distance being restricted when AFK.
- Spectator mode players can bypass AFK by default
- All of the above is customisable in config.yml.
